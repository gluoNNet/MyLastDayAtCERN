Different concepts for such a facility are being studied in Europe the United States and Japan. The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is being developed at CERN as a possible future project beyond the LHC. The CLIC concept is based on an innovative two-beam acceleration scheme promising the generation and collision of nanometer-size particle beams. The high accelerating gradients of CLIC would reduce the size of such a facility and allow for an energy reach of up to 3 TeV center-of-mass. The basic scheme of CLIC its promises its challenges and its past achievements are explained.<BR><BR><B>Prerequisite knowledge and references:</B><BR>Classical mechanics classical electro-dynamics (e.g. J.D.
